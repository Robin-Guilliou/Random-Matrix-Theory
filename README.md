# Random-Matrix-Theory

Analysis of the correlation structure of random systems and factor models.

We compare the average eigenvalue distribution of correlation matrices to the Marcenko-Pastur distribution for random systems and simple stylized factor models. We also check if the eigenvector components follow a Gaussian distribution. This is the case for random systems as stated by the Porter-Thomas law.

A description of the concepts as well as the implementation are provided in the notebook.
